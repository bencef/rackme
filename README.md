# rackme

An interface for the [acme](http://man.cat-v.org/plan_9/4/acme) editor's filesystem in racket.
I'm new to racket. If anyone is willing to package this properly feel free to contact me.

Also any issues/pull requests are welcome.

The directory `lib` contains the code which should be packaged as a racket collection.
The cmdlets us it as a library.
The other directories contain cmdlets invokable from acme.

The project is in infancy right now meaning
* It doesn't do anythin useful yet
* Everything is suspect to change

TODO:
* Learn about racket collections
* Add a Makfile or equivalent
